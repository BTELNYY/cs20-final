# cs20-final
A Client-Server chat program. imagine discord but bad, and websockets

# How to run
* Clone the repo
* Compile the project in VS 2023 with .NET 6.0 installed
* Run the cs20-final output first
* then run the cs20-final-client-test (its not longer a test, I just didn't rename it)
* Follow prompts in client as needed, for IP and port (if you are running locally, which you should be), just press enter. I suggest entering a name.
* You can connect multiple clients, if you want to, you can run the powershell script to run a lot of clients

# Not bugs
* Client crashes when the server disconnects it
* Miscolored text in server console
* You cannot run multipleservers on the same IP/port
