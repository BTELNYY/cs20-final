Client Connects

Client sends version packet -> Server checks version 
IF version NOT Server Version then disconnect client
Server Sends version packet -> Client checks
Client chooses to either stop the connection or continue

Client sends encryption packet, if using Async encryption sends public key
if server has async encryption, server sends public key back

Test encryption, server comes up with random value only known to server, encrypts and sends to client.
client decrypts and reads number, then using encryption or not sends it back to server, 
if the number does not match the servers expected number, disconnect client due to bad encryption
